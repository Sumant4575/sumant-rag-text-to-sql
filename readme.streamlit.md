README: City Statistics Query Application

A Streamlit-based interactive chatbot powered by LlamaIndex, OpenAI, and SQL that allows users to query city statistics using natural language. The application utilizes RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques, integrating SQL query processing with semantic search over city data

Features
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Natural Language Query to SQL: Converts user queries into SQL statements for city statistics.
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ LlamaCloud Integration: Uses LlamaIndex for enhanced semantic search.
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Streamlit Interface: Simple UI for users to input questions.
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ On-the-fly Database Creation: A temporary SQLite database is initialized in-memory.
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Workflow-based Routing: Implements a query-routing mechanism
